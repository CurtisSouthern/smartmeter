        <P>The next chart shows how your average consumption varies over the day, compared with the deemed profile, which is applied for 
        most domestic customers who aren't on time of use tariffs. If your use is higher during the periods with lower average price, you
        will probably find that you would have saved money on a time of use tariff. If your use is higher during the periods with higher average 
        price, then you can expect to pay more over time as your use is being subsidised by others. The prices shown are Octopus Agile 
        half-hourly prices for your region, which I believe are the best reflection of what it costs to serve you electricity.</P> 
        <canvas id="myChart2"></canvas>
        <BR>
        
        <P>The final table shows what your average price would have been each month on Octopus Agile first given your actual consumption, and then assuming
        your volume had been shaped according to the deemed profile. Monthly volumes are shown (note that the first and last month may not include
        a full month of consumption.)</P>

        {table3}<BR>
        <P>The deemed profile prices are likely to be significantly lower than current market tariffs. This is partly because market tariffs average 
        a full year, including higher prices in winter. It is also because current Agile prices are lower than were expected when most of the current market
        tariffs were set.</P>
